(comment
  ; An alternative to load-from-disk and write-to-disk would be print-dup,
  ; it retains metadata and type info but is less readable than walk-term
  ; But anyhow without pretty print and with more and more entities, it isnt readable anyway.
  ; Another disadvantage that it only dispatches on class, so it doesnt work for item.
